    <h1>David's Vegan Feta Pasta</h1>
    <p>This is my vegan version of that viral feta pasta recipe. It's a little more work, but still pretty easy. And I think it tastes way better. You can use the feta instead of the ingredients here of course too. Gonna do it over the stove instead of in the oven, it's faster, maybe 20-30 minutes. I didn't take pics of all the steps and I'm not great at food photography anyway but it's enough to get the idea.<br>- David DeMair

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>2-3 cups cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>1lb pasta</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>1-2 shallots</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pureed kalamata olives</li>
      <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>black pepper</li>
      <li>red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 cup cashew cream (blended 2:1, overnight soaked cashews:water)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast powder</li>
      <li>small splash of balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li>fresh chopped basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Olive oil and 2-3 cups cherry tomatoes over medium/high heat. Start the pasta (1lb) at the same time in salted water.
      </li>
      <li>Once the tomatoes start to cook down a bit and release their liquid, start adding other ingredients. One or two thinly sliced shallots.
      </li>
      <li>Kalamata olives, pureed with a little olive oil. Maybe half a cup. Throw in a couple garlic cloves here too, or just chop them separately. Black pepper, some red pepper flakes. No salt yet.
      </li>
      <li>Let that cook until all the tomatoes burst and you have a sauce. You can help it along a little by smashing the tomatoes with a spoon. In the meantime, the pasta is probably done so drain it and save some of the pasta water for later.
      </li>
      <li>Now is when you would add the feta, but I'm using cashew cream instead. About a cup. It's pretty easy to find recipes for this online, but you basically just soak raw cashews overnight, then blend with water at about a 2:1 (cashews:water) ratio by volume until creamy. If you do use feta, I would definitely leave out the olives above.
      </li>
      <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast powder. ok to leave out if you don't have this, but it does help simulate the cheese flavor.
      </li>
      <li>splash of balsamic vinegar. just a bit, tomatoes are already pretty acidic.
      <li>Add in the pasta and a little bit of the reserved pasta water and mix everything up. Take it off the heat. Salt to taste but you probably won't need any more between the olives and the salt from the added water.
      </li>
      <li>Mix in fresh chopped basil. Probably more than you think is a reasonable amount. Save a couple leaves for garnish (I forgot to do this).
      </li>
      <li>And that's it! It was fun experimenting with this. If anyone tries it let me know!
